## Imaginary Scenario

We're launching a new life insurance product targeting South African millennials. The cover amount is better than any other competitor, more affordable, and changes as you go through your various life stages. It's completely transparent, with no hidden fees and powered by intelligent AI algorithms.<br><br>

## UX Exercise

Ideate and present a working page journey that streamlines the process of applying for life insurance online.
Focus on the sign up journey based on a set of provided questions that will determine the individual's health status and risk. Target a South African millennial persona that is tech savvy while still accommodating users that are not.
Outline your concept in sketch format to illustrate the UX journey. Think of using different types of engagement that would connect with the target persona and also set one_s apart from a very noisy market.<br><br>

## Coding Exercise

Once you have finalised a concept, bring it to life using your choice of Next.js or React. Where possible avoid using libraries and try keep dependencies to a minimum - we want to see the way you approach the implementation.
Complete the coding exercise in a new Github repo and provide a link once you are done.<br><br>

Question API endpoint: `https://6356e07f2712d01e14fe89d4.mockapi.io/api/v1/questions`<br><br>

How much time you invest in this exercise is entirely up to you, but we advise you not to spend more than seven days on your implementation. Take us on a journey of your problem-solving process and how you got to your final concept.<br><br>

You will be evaluated based on the originality and implementation of your ideas as well the structure of your code.<br><br>

Have fun, ask questions and don't get stressed out.
Let me know if you're keen to show off your skills in this exercise and when you would like to present your concept and implementation to the team?<br><br>

We look forward to being surprised and delighted.<br><br>
